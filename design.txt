This document explains reasons behind design decisions.

1. This is a error reporting library.
2. It provides:
   A. Means of catching errors.
   B. Means of reporting errors.
3. Type of errors caught:
   A. Errors raised to the top level.
   B. Unhandled promise rejections raised to the top level.
   C. Proxy script errors (PAC-scripts).
4. PAC-script errors are not relevant if extension doesn't
   control proxy settings (if PAC-script doesn't belong to
   extension, why to handle its errors?).
5. We don't need to know proxy settings posession at any
   moment, only at the moment of exception handling.
